# Connections Labs Week 4

Hi everyone 👋🏼

This is a submission for Project 1 (Week 4) of IMA Low Res @ NYU (Fall 2022). It's still a work in progress for Midterm Project 1 for the Connections Lab class. The core idea is an Interactive Solar System which has a solar system visualizer. Clicking into a planet (or the sun) reveals certain facts, each with their own visualization.

Enjoy 😊
